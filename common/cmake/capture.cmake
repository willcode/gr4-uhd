# CAPTURE_DEVICES, the device directories it carries. It then adds each device directory,
# whose CMakeLists.txt calls capture_device() and capture_test(), and calls capture_finish()
# once after the last one. The top keeps its own libraries, its install rules and its package.
#
# The variables a top may set ahead of the include:
# - CAPTURE_PACKAGE, the name of the package the top installs, with CAPTURE_PACKAGE_BLOCKS,
#   the name gr_add_block_library() gives the device's registration. A device's block
#   library is then <package>-blocks, exported as blocks, and CAPTURE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR is
#   include/<package>. Unset, a device's block library is capture-<device>-blocks, exported
#   as <device>-blocks, and CAPTURE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR is include.
# - CAPTURE_TEST_LABEL, capture by default, the label of every case capture_test() adds.
# - CAPTURE_UT_VARIABLE, CAPTURE_UT_INCLUDE_DIR by default, the setting the configure asks
#   a user for where it finds no boost/ut.hpp.
