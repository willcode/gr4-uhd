/*| role: the parts every device sink block shares: the full-scale contract, the queue in front
        of the device, and the vocabulary its counters are stated in.
    frame: a sink takes CF32 on its input port, stages it in a ring and lets its own drain hand
        that ring to the device. The work call never waits: what does not fit stays on the input
        edge and the scheduler offers it again.
    why: the ring comes from capture/common/Ring.hpp, which carries no GNU Radio 4 either, so a
        caller that wants the full-scale contract alone takes the two headers and nothing more.
        The queue sizing here names a rate rather than a ring, which is why it sits beside the
        contract and not with the ring.

/*| contract: one part of a sample brought inside the range a sink states. A part that is not a
        number comes back as zero, which a sink can always carry.
    trap: clipped and never wrapped. A part past full scale cast into an integer format wraps to
        the opposite sign, which turns an overdriven sample into a loud one of the wrong
        polarity — a different signal, spread across the whole band, rather than a distorted
        version of the intended one. A NaN answers false to both comparisons, so a pair of them
        alone hands it straight on: the integer conversions then round it to whatever is left,
        against a contract that states full scale 1.0.
    why: a sink converts each part through this function, so the clip holds for a new sink
        as well.

        a pause threw away after the caller had handed them over. discardedAtRateChange counts
        the samples a rate change threw away, which are the ones the play-out before it could
        not place. unsentAtStop counts the samples still queued when a stop's deadline expired.

/*| contract: the ring capacity for a rate, in samples of sampleBytes bytes: bound.seconds of

        and never above the largest power of two of samples that fits bound.maxBytes. The floor
        wins over the ceiling. A rate that is not positive, a duration that is not positive and
        a ceiling that is not positive each leave the floor or the part of the rule that still
        holds.
    why: a quarter of a second is long enough that a scheduling delay on the thread filling the
        ring does not starve the device, and short enough that the tail a stop plays out before
        it releases the device is a quarter of a second. Every wait a sink makes is sized from
        this queue, so a floor above the rate's own quarter second lengthens all of them.
    why: the ceiling bounds the storage at the fastest rates, where the duration's worth is
        gigabytes and the device's own buffer holds microseconds.
    frame: the rounding puts the time held between the duration and just under twice it, the
        worst rate being the one just past a power of two, below the ceiling.

/*| role: what a rate change owes the device: whether the rate reaches it at all, whether the

    contract: a request equal to the rate in force, or one that is not a positive number, asks
        for nothing. A new rate always reaches the device; the burst ends and the transfer
        restarts only where one is running.
    why: the staged settings map is replayed shortly after the stream starts, so a rate applier
        runs at least twice with the same value. A rate written while a transfer runs can stop a
        device's sample clock until it is reset, and a rate given mid-burst sends the samples
        already staged at the old one.
