    why: a header of plain values with no dependency of its own. A consumer that draws a

/*| contract: bound one value to what a descriptor states this control can take. The answer is

        entries are the value itself, widened to [min, max] where the list is anyInRange. A value that is not a number comes back as the
        descriptor's default. A descriptor stating no usable domain, max below min, leaves the
        value alone rather than collapsing it.
    trap: std::clamp answers NaN for NaN, neither comparison holding, so a stored value read
        back as one reaches a family's setControl and its device call unbounded. The default is
        the one value in the domain that every descriptor carries.
    trap: an enum's domain is its option count, and not min and max. A descriptor built field by
        field that names its options and leaves the range alone has hi < lo false at 0 and 0, so
        every selection would clamp to the first option. Every enum descriptor in this library
        sets the range from the option count, so no instance shows it.
    trap: a steps control's listValues are a display ladder over the step index rather than the
        value domain, so only kind 4 reads them as values.
    why: a device parameter whose legal domain moves with the sample rate states the domain in
        force, so a value stored under one rate cannot reach the device under another that
        cannot carry it. This is the arithmetic; each family's describeControls() states the
        domain and each family's setControl() applies the same bound at the device. A stored
        value outlives the state it was stored under, so the bound belongs wherever such a value
        is read as well as where it is written.
