/*| role: a family's device listing in the form GNU Radio 4's device listing registry takes,
        and its registration there. A block library registers its family's listing when it
        loads, so a program that loads the library lists the family's units through
        gr::PluginLoader::listDevices() without holding a block type.
    frame: the declarations stand under CAPTURE_DEVICE_LISTINGS, which the configure defines
        where a probe against the core it found compiles and links a registration. Against a
        core without <gnuradio-4.0/DeviceListing.hpp> this header declares nothing, and a
        block library registers its blocks alone.
